    <div class="intro">

        The Melbourne Cricket Ground is a historical sporting stadium which is located in Melbourne. In addition to hosting Australian Rules Football, it has also been known to host Cricket, Soccer, Rugby League, Rugby Union and even the Olympics.

        <br><br>

        The first match of Cricket was played between the MCC (Melbourne Cricket Club) and a military team on the Old Mint site in William Street, Melbourne. However, the area proved to be unsuitable and so they moved to a second ground at the foot of Batmanâ€™s Hill, which is now known as Spencer Street Station (or Southern Cross Station). However, due to the railway being built, they were again forced to vacate. They had to move around quite a bit before they eventually settled at the site that it is now.

        <br><br>

        The first VFL Grand Final was played there in 1902. Since then, with a few exceptions due to the war, every VFL and AFL Grand Final has been played there.

    <div class="assignment-info">
        The brief for this assignment required me to re-brand an existing company that is related to tourism somewhere in the World. The chosen company - Melbourne Cricket Ground - is in desperate need of a rebrand. Alongside this, a campaign for the 150th birthday of the stadium has been designed.

        <br><br>

        The rebrand includes a new logo, billboards, bus shelter posters, merchandise, a website, and the campaign for the 150th birthday.

        <br><br>

        To display all of this work, we were asked to make a brand book which outlines all the aspects of the rebrand.

        <br><br><br>
        Below are some examples of the proposed rebrand.
