      </div>

      <div class="text">
        Unter is my main studio class for University which focuses on identifying problems and coming up with an effective solution for it. My project focuses on the fact that photography is becoming more accessible for people with smartphones taking over the technology world. To help with this transition, I hope to teach people how to take better photos with what they have at their disposal, whether thats a basic smartphone or a high end DSLR.

        <a href="twitter/index.html">/Twitter Typography</a>
      </div>

      <div class="text">
        Twitter typography is a project that was undertaken in my digital publishing class, where we were assigned a random twitter account, and we had to visualise some of their tweets using text, colour and animations. As each week progressed, we were allowed to use more and more new code.

        <a href="scp/index.html">/SCP Foundation/E-Zine</a>
      </div>

      <div class="text">
        SCP Foundation/E-Zine is a project where we had to choose an existing <a href="http://web.textfiles.com/ezines/">E zine</a> (<-- click to explore e-zines), and compare it to something of the modern day. I chose the <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/">SCP foundation</a> (<-- Click to explore SCP Foundation), because it is a similar concept where you have a bunch of random stories that don't have anything to do with eachother but make sense. We were also required to produce a book to visualise this.

        <a href="future-signals/index.html">/Future Signals</a>
      </div>

      <div class="text">
        Future signals is a Digital publishing assignment where we were required to find something in society that will be obselete in the next 10 years, and why this is the case. I chose video games as my topic and how the digital games are taking over the physical games. I explore how in this process, glitches occur, patches are released, and we no longer get complete games at launch.

      </div>

      <div class="text">
        Geo Graphics was a project done for Digital pubishing where we imagine what the world flag would look like if all the continents combined and connected in a digital space. We had to come up with portions of a flag which would then be displayed randomly on a website to show everyone's work.

      </div>

      <div class="text">
        LAN3000 is all about making a website for public good. I chose to make a database for students about royalty free music. I chose this because it can sometimes be hard as a student to find music and sounds to use in a project that is free to use.

      </div>

      <div class="text">
        Branding for Designers is another third year subject which required us to re-brand something existing. I chose the MCG because it is home to the sport I am passionate about. The rebrand involved a lot of different assets, including a logo, billboards and posters for a campaign, and a website, just to name a few.

        This Project is a little thing I did while travelling around Vietnam and Singapore. As an aspiring photographer, I think it is important to start displaying my photography skills online. Feel free to check out my instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ferguseatonphotography/?hl=en">@ferguseatonphotography</a> where I try and post as many photos as possible.
