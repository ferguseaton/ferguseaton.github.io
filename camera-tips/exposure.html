    Exposure is something that will drastically change how your photo looks. It is a good tool to use in combination with other tools (like HDR).
    <br>
    Some cameras have the option to shoot in RAW format, and this allows for more adjustment in the editing phase of your photos, however it is ideal to have the exposure as close as you can to what you want when you actually take the photo. 
    <br>
    <br>
    If you over or under-expose a photo, it is likely that you will lose quality in the sky or reflective surfaces, but if you get it just right you will have nearly the same amount of information in those areas as the rest of the photos.
    <br><br>
    In our app, the exposure slider down the bottom is always there so can manually adjust the photo as you go, or there is also the option to enable the smart exposure feature.
    <br><br>
    Our Smart Exposure feature automatically adjusts the exposure based on the available light when taking a photo. Please note that on a lot of smartphones, exposure is done digitally and can result in quality loss. Try and shoot in good light to begin with to avoid using this feature.

    Below are some example photos of the correct exposure used in photography to achieve as close to real-life lighting as possible.

    Over-exposure or under-exposure would have resulted in lack of detail in the water and skies.
